## Overview
This project performs data exploration, cleaning, and analysis on a dataset from [Zepto](https://www.zepto.com/)â€”a grocery delivery service. The dataset was imported from Kaggle and contains information about product pricing, availability, and weights.

| Column Name               | Data Type          | Description                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| CATEGORY                 | VARCHAR(100)       | Product category                                |
| NAME                     | VARCHAR(100)       | Product name                                    |

## Schema

```sql
-- CREATION OF DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE ZEPTO_DB;
USE ZEPTO_DB;

-- TABLE CREATION
CREATE TABLE ZEPTO_V2 (
CATEGORY VARCHAR(100),
NAME VARCHAR(100),
MRP INT,
DISCOUNTEDPERCENTAGE INT,
AVAILABLEQUANTITY INT,
DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE INT,
WEIGHTINGMS INT,
OUTOFSTOCK ENUM('TRUE','FALSE'),
QUANTITY INT
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Sample Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM ZEPTO_V2 LIMIT 20;
```


### 2. Data Exploration

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CATEGORY FROM ZEPTO_V2; -- DIFFERENT PRODUCT CATEGORIES
SELECT COUNT(OUTOFSTOCK) FROM ZEPTO_V2 GROUP BY OUTOFSTOCK; -- COUNT OF OUTOFSTOCK AND INSTOCK
SELECT NAME,COUNT(NAME) AS OCCURENCE FROM ZEPTO_V2 GROUP BY NAME HAVING OCCURENCE > 1; -- PRODUCT HAVING MORE THAN 1 OCCURENCE
```

### 3. Data Cleaning - Cleaning unnecessary data and modifying data

```sql
SELECT * FROM ZEPTO_V2 WHERE DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE = 0 OR MRP = 0; -- CHECKING IF ANY PRODUCT'S COST IS 0
DELETE FROM ZEPTO_V2 WHERE MRP = 0 OR DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE = 0; -- DELETING THE ENTRY WHERE MRP OR SELLING PRICE IS 0

UPDATE ZEPTO_V2 
SET MRP = MRP/100,
	DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE = DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE/100 WHERE MRP IS NOT NULL; -- CONVERTING AMOUNT (PAISE -> RUPEES)
```

### 4. TOP 10 BEST VALUE PRODUCTS BASED ON THE DISCOUNTE PERCENTAGE

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM ZEPTO_V2 ORDER BY DISCOUNTPERCENT DESC LIMIT 10;
```



### 5. PRODUCTS WITH HIGH MRP BUT OUTOFSTOCK

```sql
SELECT * FROM ZEPTO_V2 WHERE OUTOFSTOCK = 'TRUE' AND MRP > (SELECT AVG(MRP) FROM ZEPTO_V2);
```

### 6. ESTIMATED REVENUE FROM EACH CATEGORY

```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, SUM(DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE * AVAILABLEQUANTITY) AS ESTIMATED_REVENUE FROM ZEPTO_V2 GROUP BY CATEGORY;
```


### 7.  FIND ALL PRODUCTS WHERE MRP IS GREATER THAN 500 AND DISCOUNT IS LESS THAN 10 %

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM ZEPTO_V2 WHERE MRP > 500 AND DISCOUNTPERCENT < 10;
```


### 8. FIND PRICE PER GRAM FOR PRODUCTS ABOVE 100G AND SORT BY BEST VALUE

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CATEGORY,NAME,DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE,WEIGHTINGMS, ROUND(DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE/WEIGHTINGMS,2) AS PRICE_PER_GM
FROM ZEPTO_V2 WHERE WEIGHTINGMS >= 100;
```

### 9. GROUP ITEMS IN LOW, MEDIUM OR BULK

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CATEGORY,NAME,WEIGHTINGMS,
CASE WHEN WEIGHTINGMS < 1000 THEN 'LOW'
	 WHEN WEIGHTINGMS < 5000 THEN 'MEDIUM'
     ELSE 'BULK'
     END AS WEIGHT
FROM ZEPTO_V2;
```

### 10. TOTAL INVENTORY WEIGHT PER CATEGORY

```sql
SELECT CATEGORY, SUM(WEIGHTINGMS * AVAILABLEQUANTITY) AS TOTAL_INVENTORY_WEIGHT FROM ZEPTO_V2 GROUP BY CATEGORY;
```


## Findings and Conclusion

- **Products with zero MRP or price were identified and removed for accuracy.
- **Top 10 products were sorted based on discount percentage to showcase best value items.
- **Out-of-stock high MRP items could indicate high demand or stock issues.
- **Category-wise estimated revenue and inventory weight were calculated to inform logistics and pricing strategy.
- **Products were classified as Low, Medium, or Bulk based on weight, supporting better categorization and stock planning.
